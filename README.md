# LSC Open Data Workshop #1: Hands-on excercises

Material to support the first
[LSC Open Data Workshop](https://losc.ligo.org/s/workshop1/),
March 25-27, 2018

## Software setup

Suggestions for accessing the required software are
available in the [setup directory](./setup/README.md)

## Hands-on Session Program

### Day 1

#### Suggested tutorials:

[intro](./intro) - **Introductory tutorials 1 and 2** provide an introduction to
data access and resources on the Open Science Center web site.

[gwpy](./gwpy) - **gwpy tutorials 1, 2, and 3**
introduce the `gwpy` software pacakge.  This includes a variety of
tools for discovering, reading, writing, and plotting gravitational wave
data.  

#### Topics:
 * Discover, download, and read data
 * FFTs, PSDs, and whitening
 * Working with segments lists and Timelines
 * Plot spectrograms to identify glitches, signals, and hardware injections

### Day 2

#### Suggested tutorials:

[intro](./intro) - **Introductory tutorial 3** provides an introduction
to using matched filtering to identify CBC signals

[pycbc](./pycbc) - **pycbc tutorials 1, 2, 3, and 4** provide an introduction
to the `pycbc` software package.  This analysis package is designed to
analyze gravitational-wave data, identify CBC signals
and estimate their parameters.  

[skymaps](./skymaps) - **Skymap tutorials 1, 2, and 3** introduce how to read in and use sky localization probability maps to help identify the likely source locations of observed signals.


#### Topics:
 * GW signals from compact object mergers
 * Matched filtering to identify compact object mergers
 * Working with compact object merger parameters and waveforms
 * Working with skymaps to identify likely source locations


## Day 3: 

#### Suggested Tutorials:

[parameter_estimation](./parameter_estimation) - **Parameter estimation tutorials** introduce how Bayesian inference is used to fit model waveforms to the data.

#### Topics:
 * Parameter estimation
 * Explore CBC workflows
 * Collaborate on individual research projects
 * Complete tutorials from days 1 and 2
 * Begin work on "more to explore" advanced excercises
